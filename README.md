# Functions

1. Activate windows 11/10 pro
2. Install Office Deployment Tool (ODT)
3. Run the ODT
4. Create the Configuration.xml file
5. Download Office 2024 LTSC and activate it automatically.
6. It will cleanup all other files except for the ones in the Downloads folder. After closing the script you can manually delete them.

# Installation
Go to the releases tab and download the newest version.

# Important
This is not illegal to my knowledge. I would add a icon to the file but if i did i would have to use a software and i couldnt find any that wouldnt install viruses when the .exe file is ran.
